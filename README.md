# Waku Project Management

*For tracking and project management processes please see* [PROCESS.md](./PROCESS.md)

## Roadmap & Milestones

High Overview of approved milestones and roadmap can be found in https://roadmap.logos.co/messaging/milestones
Milestones and deliverables can be found in GitHub: https://github.com/logos-messaging/pm/milestones

Outbound requirements, inbound requirements and Logos Messaging's response can be found in [REQUIREMENTS.md](requirements/README.md)

We use the FURPS+ framework to specify software and some non-software requirements.
Due to the desired properties of our software, `+` is used to express _privacy_, _anonymity_, _censorship-resistance_ and _deployments_ requirements.
